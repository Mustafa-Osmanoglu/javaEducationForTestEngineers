Course by Ozan Ilhan
I watched this course and I am uploading my code applications that I saw in the course and in parallel with this, here.
Update at 2.04.2025 2:13 There was a special situation for this course, I finished watching it and gained general information. I will watch this course again from the beginning and add it to github in parallel after some changes because there should be no copyright, this course is a paid Ozan Ä°lhan course.
